      "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sunlight is made of all colors:** Sunlight appears white, but it's actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sunlight enters the atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scattering of light:** This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rayleigh Scattering:** Rayleigh scattering is a type of scattering that occurs when the size of the particles (air molecules) is much smaller than the wavelength of the light.  The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This means that shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red and orange).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why blue, not violet?**  Violet light is scattered even more than blue light. However, several factors contribute to why we see the sky as blue rather than violet:\n",
      "    *   The sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
      "    *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
      "    *   The upper atmosphere absorbs some of the violet light.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Our perception:** As a result, we see the sky as blue because blue light is scattered more effectively throughout the atmosphere and reaches our eyes from all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short: Shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more by the air molecules in the atmosphere than longer wavelengths (red and orange). Because blue is scattered the most, we see the sky as blue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why sunsets are red/orange:**\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunset (or sunrise), the sunlight has to travel through a much greater distance of the atmosphere to reach our eyes.  This means that most of the blue light has already been scattered away by the time it reaches us. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are scattered less and can penetrate through the atmosphere to reach our eyes, resulting in the reddish/orange colors we see during sunsets and sunrises.\n",

He becomes so obsessed that he loses his sanity and decides to become a knight-errant himself, renaming himself Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the core elements of the story:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Delusion:** Don Quixote believes everything he's read in the romances is true. He sees himself as a noble knight on a quest for justice and adventure. He's completely out of touch with reality and interprets ordinary things as fantastical adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sancho Panza:** Don Quixote recruits a simple, illiterate farmer named Sancho Panza as his squire. Sancho is the voice of reason and practicality, constantly trying (and failing) to bring Don Quixote back to earth. He's motivated by the promise of being made governor of an island. Sancho provides comic relief and a grounding perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Adventures (and Misadventures):** Don Quixote embarks on a series of \"adventures\" that are fueled by his delusions. These include:\n",
      "    *   **Attacking windmills he believes are giants.** This is perhaps the most famous episode.\n",
      "    *   **Fighting sheep, mistaking them for armies.**\n",
      "    *   **Releasing galley slaves, believing he's freeing the wrongly accused.** This often backfires on him.\n",
      "    *   **Imagining a peasant girl, Aldonza Lorenzo, as his noble lady love, Dulcinea del Toboso.** He never actually meets her, and she is completely unaware of his affection.\n",
      "    *   **Constantly getting beaten and humiliated, yet refusing to acknowledge reality.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Themes:** The novel explores many themes, including:\n",
      "    *   **The Power of Imagination vs. Reality:** The central conflict is the clash between Don Quixote's imaginative world and the harsh reality he faces.\n",
      "    *   **The Nature of Sanity and Madness:** It questions what it means to be sane and explores the fine line between genius and madness.\n",
      "    *   **The Ideal vs. the Real:** It contrasts the romantic ideals of chivalry with the often-unromantic realities of life.\n",
      "    *   **The Power of Stories:** It examines how stories can shape our perceptions and even drive our actions.\n",
      "    *   **Friendship and Loyalty:** Despite their differences, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza develop a deep bond of friendship and loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Ending:** Eventually, after much suffering and humiliation, Don Quixote is defeated and returns home. He slowly regains his sanity and renounces his chivalric fantasies. He dies a disillusioned but wiser man, accepting reality before it's too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don Quixote\" is a complex and multi-layered novel. It is often considered one of the greatest works of literature ever written, not only for its comedic value but also for its profound exploration of human nature and the complexities of the human condition.\n",

      "*   **Alliance with the Mughals:** Both the Kachwaha and Rathore rulers, at various points in history, formed alliances with the Mughal Empire. These alliances influenced their cultures, architecture, and political landscape. While there were also conflicts, the periods of alliance led to exchanges of ideas and artistic styles.\n",
      "*   **Integration into India:** After India's independence in 1947, both Jaipur and Jodhpur acceded to the Union of India, becoming part of the state of Rajasthan.\n",
      "*   **Tourism and Heritage:** Today, both cities are major tourist destinations, known for their historical forts, palaces, and vibrant culture. They contribute significantly to Rajasthan's tourism industry.\n",
      "*   **Cultural Similarities:** Being part of Rajasthan, both cities share many cultural similarities, including language (Rajasthani), cuisine, traditions, festivals, music, and dance forms.\n",
      "*   **Architectural Influences:** Both cities showcase a blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles, reflecting the historical interactions between the two powers.\n",
      "*   **Desert Landscape:** Both are situated in the Thar Desert region, influencing their architecture, lifestyle, and traditions. The desert environment has shaped their water conservation techniques, building materials, and cultural adaptations.\n",
